<h2>About me:</h2>

<b>Hi! I'm Physic, also known as "Physic91".

In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, doing interesting activities, or simply looking into the air and thinking about nothing.
 I also love listening to music, playing games, and thinking about how they are programmed behind the scenes.</b>

<h2>Where it all started</h2> 
<b>My programming journey began with a deep curiosity about how games work behind the scenes.
Playing games on Roblox inspired me to explore scripting and game development.
In 2024, I started learning Lua and quickly became passionate about creating systems, preventing exploits and optimizing game performance.
Since then, I have continued to build projects, debug complex problems, and improve my skills every day.
I‚Äôm excited to keep pushing my limits and learn about more new stuffs.</b>

<h2>Beyond Roblox Development</h2>
<b>Besides working extensively with Roblox Studio and Lua scripting, I have also gained experience with other development environments and languages.
I have worked with Java using Eclipse IDE and VSC(Visual Studio Code), where I developed small applications and learned important concepts like object-oriented programming and clean code structure.
Additionally, I have spent time working with C# in Unity(Using Visual Studio), focusing on basic gameplay programming, system logic, and understanding how game engines handle real-time interactions.
This cross-platform experience has strengthened my understanding of programming fundamentals and helped me adapt quickly to new tools and technologies.</b>
