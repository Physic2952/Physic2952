## About Me
Hi! I'm **Physic**, also known as "Physic91".  
I enjoy movies, exploring interesting activities, or just staring into the air and thinking.  
I love music, gaming, and discovering how games are programmed behind the scenes.

## Where It All Started
My programming journey began with curiosity about how games work. Playing Roblox inspired me to learn scripting and game development. In 2024, I started learning Lua and quickly became passionate about creating systems, preventing exploits, and optimizing performance. Since then, Iâ€™ve built projects, debugged complex problems, and improved my skills daily.

## Beyond Roblox
Besides Roblox Studio and Lua, I have experience with Java (Eclipse & VS Code) and C# (Unity). I developed small apps, learned object-oriented programming, and built gameplay systems. This cross-platform experience strengthened my fundamentals and adaptability.
